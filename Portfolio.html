        <p>The Android operating system is a mobile operating system developed by Google (GOOGL?) primarily for touchscreen devices, cell phones, and tablets.
        Its design allows users to manipulate mobile devices intuitively, with phone interactions that mirror common motions, such as pinching, swiping, and tapping.
        In addition to mobile devices, Google employs Android software in televisions, cars, and wristwatches, each fitted with unique user interfaces.

            Apple iOS is based on the Mac OS X operating system for desktop and laptop computers. The iOS developer kit provides tools that allow for iOS app development.
            Designed for use with Apple's multitouch devices, the mobile OS supports input through direct manipulation. The system responds to various user gestures, such as pinching, tapping and swiping.

        <p>
            All joking aside, Android and iOS are the clear leaders in mobile operating systems around the globe, and the idea for each is to provide the fastest, smoothest and most robust performance and features as possible.
            With different approaches to these tasks, it is about time we did an official Android vs iOS comparison.

    <h2>Websites Responsivos</h2>

<div class="flex-container">

        <img src="imgs/web1.jpg">
        <p>
            Web developer responsibilities include building our website from concept all the way to completion from the bottom up, fashioning everything from the home page to site layout and function.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src="imgs/web2.jpg">
        <p>
            If you love web design and development, enjoy working independently, and are willing to work at home, your job prospects are rosy; the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that industry demand is anticipated to increase 15% by 2026.
            A few other “pluses”- many entry-level jobs only require an Associate’s degree, most web developers enjoy the freedom and work / life balance of being self-employed, and the median salary for web developers was $32.69 an hour ($67,990 a year) in 2017.

        <p>
            Web developers design and build websites.
            They are typically responsible for the appearance, of the site and technical aspects, such as site speed and how much traffic the site can handle.
            Web developers may also create site content that requires technical features.

            Whether you're looking for a game industry career or simply curious about the way game developers think, Extra Credits makes video game design approachable by exploring concepts like gamification, perfect imbalance, the skinner box, the uncanny valley, and more.

        <p>
            Games developers use their creative flair and technical prowess to create the video games that keep us glued to the screen for hours, days and sometimes weeks at a time.
        </p>

        <p>
            Games publishers (e.g. EA Sports) divide up the programming, testing and design duties in different ways. Consequently, you might be responsible for performing a combination of tasks.
        </p>

        <img src="imgs/game4.jpg">
        <p>
            Video game developers, also known as games developers or video game programmers, write code for games for a variety of formats, such as PCs, consoles, web browsers and mobile phones. They take the video game designer’s ideas, drawings and rules, and turn them into a playable game with visuals and sound through writing code.
